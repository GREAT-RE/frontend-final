                <p className='augusta-text'>"Rua Cor de Rosa" or "Pink Street" is a popular street in the Cais do Sodr√© 
                                            neighborhood of Lisbon, Portugal.<br></br><br></br> It was formerly known as "Rua Nova do 
                                            Carvalho" and was a seedy area filled with strip clubs and bars. However, in 
                                            recent years, it has been transformed into a trendy nightlife destination with
                                            colorful pink pavement, street art, and a variety of bars, restaurants, and 
                                            clubs.<br></br><br></br> The street is closed to traffic at night and becomes a pedestrian zone,
                                            drawing large crowds of locals and tourists alike. It is definitely one of the 
                                            most famous streets in Lisbon's nightlife scene.</p>
